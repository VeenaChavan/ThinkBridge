You can change values for your case.

1. [junit-platform.properties](src/test/resources/junit-platform.properties)<br/>
   > If a properties file with this name is present in the root of the classpath, it will be used as a source for configuration parameters. If multiple files are present, only the first one detected in the classpath will be used.
2. [allure.properties](src/test/resources/allure.properties)<br/>
   > Configuring all Allure properties by passing classpath.
3. [categories.json](src/test/resources/categories.json) for Allure Report<br/>
   > Defining categories to group tests.<br/>
   > **Category structure:**<br/>
   > ```json
    > {
    >   "name": "{Category name}",
    >   "matchedStatuses": "{One or more statuses of tests}",
    >   "traceRegex": "{Exception name}",
    >   "messageRegex": "{The content or description of Exception}"
    > }
    > ```
   > **Define a category by the following:**<br/>
   > - `matchedStatuses` -> The status of test, one in `skipped`, `passed`, `broken`, `failed`, `unknown`<br/>
   > - `traceRegex` -> Find the exception caused status to the test<br/>
   > - `messageRegex` -> Get content or description shortly or fully<br/>
   > - `name` -> Set category name based on above keys<br/>

### **Run Tests With Gradle**
> `./gradlew clean test allureReport`<br/>

Task `allureReport`: Build report from `thinkbridge-automation\build\allure-results` folder

#### **Perform On Browsers**
- chrome

Able to select browser by passing system property `selenide.browser`<br/>
> `./gradlew clean test -Dselenide.browser=chrome allureReport`

#### **Filter Tests**
You can filter tests by using option `--tests`<br/>
Giving values can be `TestPackage`, `TestClass`, `TestMethod`
> `./gradlew clean test -Dselenide.browser=chrome --tests ExampleTest.passedTest allureReport`

### **Allure Report**
<em>`Note`: If your test command contains task `allureReport`, when tests finished you can see below message in terminal likes.</em>
> **> Task :allureReport**<br/>
> Report successfully generated to D:\thinkbridge-automation\build\reports\allure-report<br/>

Open your browser with above path by Firefox<br/>
<em>`Note`: If you see Allure report is displayed likes below image.</em>
![](images/allure-loading-firefox.png?raw=true)
<em>Then you have to do by the following:.</em>
