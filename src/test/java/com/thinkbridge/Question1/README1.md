# Question 1
Question 1:
"Shopbridge‚Äù needs you to test their website that helps track the different items they have for 
sale.
The functional requirement includes Frontend and Backend specifications. The specification 
are only to understand what aspects are covered for testing.
Frontend Requirements:
Create a page with a component at the top that can be used to add a new item to the inventory. 
The component should require a name, description, and price for the new item. You can upload 
a picture ofthe itemas well. Below the component that adds new items to the inventory, display 
a list containing the name and price of each item in the inventory. If your app supports image 
uploads, you can display a thumbnail here as well. Each item in the list should have a button to 
remove it from the inventory. Clicking on an item should bring the user to a new page with all 
the information about the selected item (name, description, price, and optionallyphoto).
All API calls should be asynchronous and not cause any full-page reloads. The only full-page 
reloads the user should see are those caused by navigating between the two pages of the app 
Regarding visual styles, the only requirement is that the content of both pages should be both 
horizontally and vertically centred.
Backend Requirements:
All the functions of the frontend need to be served by an API call and the store‚Äôs inventory 
should be persisted across restarts of the backend process. It will use a SQL database for any 
persistent data storage needs.
Tracking:
Please do your best to keep track of how long you spend on the functional analysis of each of 
the backend, frontend functionality, the frontend presentational aspects, and Test Case creation.
QA Requirements:
The deliverable shall be shared via GitHub, BitBucket, SourceTree, or any versioning System 
containing all relevant Test Cases in the correct sequence.
Evaluation and Scoring:
The design will be simple and minimal. You are free to ask any questions for clarification or 
help.
You will be evaluated on the below attributes -
- Test Case completeness of Frontend requirements
- Test Case completeness of Backend requirements
- Identify and define Test Cases for automation
Next Steps:
1. Read the requirement thoroughly. Please keep a copy of it for a reference if needed.
2. Send the deliverable to rashmi.koravi@thinkbridge.in, in the next 1 week via GitHub, 
BitBucket, or SourceTree. If not received within the specified time, we will consider it as an 
un-attempted question.
3. Click on the Submit button of this test

**Solution :**

2. It has 2 worksheets for Frontend and Backend test cases.
3. Testcases which needs to be automated have been marked with "Yes" in "To Be Automated?" column.
4. Images for application have been placed in the "ShopBridgeImages" folder.
